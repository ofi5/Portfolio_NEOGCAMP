            <h1>HAZARD</h1>
            <p>Hazard signed for English club Chelsea in June 2012. He won the UEFA Europa League in his first season and the PFA Young Player of the Year in his second. In the 2014–15 season, Hazard helped Chelsea win the League Cup and Premier League, earning him the FWA Footballer of the Year and the PFA Players' Player of the Year awards.  He won the Europa League again with Chelsea in June 2019. At Chelsea, Hazard established himself as one of the best players in the world. </p>

            <h1>DROGBA</h1>
            <p> Drogba moved to Premier League club Chelsea for a club record £24 million fee, making him the most expensive Ivorian player in history. In his debut season he helped the club win their first league title in 50 years, and a year later he won another Premier League title. His displays saw him named in the FIFA World XI for 2007. In March 2012, he became the first African player to score 100 Premier League goals.[8] Just two months later, he scored in Chelsea's 2012 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool to become the first (and as of 2017, the only) player to score in four separate FA Cup finals.[9] He also played in the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, in which he scored an 88th-minute equaliser and the winning penalty in the deciding shoot-out against Bayern Munich.</p>

        </li>
        <li class="container-center">
            <h1>CECH</h1>
            <p> During his eleven year association with the club, Čech registered 494 senior appearances, making him the club's highest overseas appearance maker, and sixth all-time.[20] He also helped the club win four Premier League titles, four FA Cups, three League Cups, one UEFA Champions League title, and one UEFA Europa League title. Čech also holds Chelsea's all-time record for clean sheets, with 228.[</p>

        <li class="container-center">
            <h1>LAMPARD</h1>
            <p>In 11 years at Stamford Bridge, Lampard has earned ten trophies and has 172 goals and 110 assists from midfield.

                He has been an integral part of the most successful Chelsea side in history.
                
                Even now, in his later years, he has been an important part of the club, netting 16 goals this season and setting up two goals in the epic Champions League semi-final conquering of Barcelona..</p>

        </li>
        <li class="container-center">
            <h1>TERRY</h1>
            <p>he has captained the Blues in the most successful period in the club's history, earning 11 trophies in thirteen years and even winning a PFA Player of the Year Award at centre back.

                His hard defending and ability to head goals in from set pieces has made him a worry for opposing teams at both ends of the pitch..</p>

        </li>
        <li class="container-center">
            <h1>ZOLA</h1>
            <p>Gianfranco Zola came to Chelsea and scored 80 goals in 297 matches.

                However, these numbers undercut Zola's importance to the club.
                
                Throughout his career at Stamford Bridge, he was a fan favourite and charmed his way into the hearts of all supporters.</p>
