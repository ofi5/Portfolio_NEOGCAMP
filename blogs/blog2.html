    </header>

    <p id="para-text">India is land to one of the longest coastlines with a 
        number of exquisite beaches. Here have a look at the
         ones which are the best according to me.</p>

    <ul reversed>

        <li class="listitems">
            <h1 class="heading3">Kudle Beach</h1>
            <div style="display:flex" class="beach-box">
            
            <p> Kudle Beach is one of the many beaches of Gokarna, situated only a short trek from Om Beach. You can reach Gokarna by a 4 hour ride from Goa.
                A complete recluse, this beach offers the most silent
                 and serene atmosphere to enjoy a sunset, a walk along the shore or simply sit and observe the never-ceasing tides. The beach is usually deserted, 
                 except for the peak months from November to February, when it is flocked by foreign
                   travellers and backpackers who choose Kudle beach for its privacy.

            <p> Kapu, is a town in Udupi district of Karnataka, India. It lies on the way between Udupi and Mangalore beside National Highway 66 (previously NH-17). 
                A place I frequently visited when I studied at Manipal. It is 20 km south of Udupi (a town famous for its ancient Krishna Temple) and 
                40 km north of Mangalore (chief port city of Karnataka). It is famous for its lighthouse and the temples and a fort built by Tippu Sultan.

            <p> Located in the middle of the Arabian Sea and the Sal River, Cavelossim Beach is a charming beach in the South Goa district in Goa. Cavelossim is actually 
                a village in the district with the beach that starts from the southernmost stretch of the Salcete beach in the north to Cavelossim in the south. Cavelossim 
                Beach in South Goa is serene, beautiful and far away from the crowd of tourists who flock to Goa. It is accessible from different parts of Goa with good 
                connectivity and infrastructure.

            <p> Set amid a beautiful setting about 10 km away from the calm and quiet hamlet of Varkala in Kerala, Varkala Beach, also known as Papanasam Beach, is a beautiful
                 stretch of sand renowned for its solitude unlike other commercial beaches of Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. The backdrop Arabian Sea against the cliffs of Kerala 
                 is a unique one since these sedimentary formation peaks are not found anywhere in the otherwise flat coastline of Kerala.Sunsets at the Varkala Beach are especially 
                 pristine and call for a serene walk along the beach. Also if you are a seafood lover, then the place is a paradise for you. The eating joints nearby offer some of
                  India's best moth watering and affordable food.
